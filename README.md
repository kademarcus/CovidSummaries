# Covid Summaries
I wanted to look at the differences in covid cases and deaths pre and post vaccine, as well as across continents. Different regions experienced different effects and handled the pandemic differntly, 
and I want to be able to show these differences in these effects, especially impacted when the vaccine was introduced

# How I did it
**Tech Used : R, PowerBI**
I used R for data preparation and to analyze correlations, and outputted the data to PowerBI in order to effectively vizualize the data and show how the world was impacted by Covid as well as the vaccine
